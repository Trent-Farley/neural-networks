        <h1>How It Works</h1>

        <h3><b>The Technical Details Simplified</b></b></h3>
        <p>

          As shown above, the evolution of a network starts with a 
          base amount of nodes (dots, compared to individuals working on a problem).
          If the goal is completed, the node gets passed to the next generation.
          To solve a problem, there may be hundreds of generations but this photo 
          just shows a few. 
        </p>
        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        <p>
            It all starts with the data. The amount of information that the internet 
            is pumping out per day is incredible. Just one social media platform 
            can have millions of photos uploaded every day. Yet, every time someone searches for 
            a photo it usually returns a photo almost instantly. This is taken for 
            granted, but the amount of algorithms and processes going through these
            photos, videos, gifs, memes, etc is increasing to handle the data.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Just How Hard Would It Be To Sort Through All This?</b></h3>
        <p>
            Sorting information is tough. Just thinking about how to sort 100 
            million of anything is mind-boggling. This task would be impossible 
            in anyone's lifetime. This is where a framework to sort these items 
            would be beneficial and if not used, would mean never finding the 
            photo that you uploaded a week ago. The quickest way to sort this 
            is to just know where the information is. Much like knowing where 
            to get socks in the morning, computer scientists have made a neural 
            network to know where everything is.
        </p>
        <h3><b>The Technical Details</b></h3>
        <p>
            Neural networks are able to process any information given, 
            as long as the starting algorithm can handle it. For this 
            information, however, I will use images as an example, but anything
            can be used. Since images are making up more and more of the internet, 
            the inner workings of how these get processed are valuable to everyone.
            There are three different ways to process information:
          </p> 
            <ul>
            <li>NYU Object Recognition Benchmark (NORB)</li>
            <li>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR10)</li>
            <li>Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNST).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><b>The Inner Workings</b></h3>
            <p>
            
            Much like children, neural networks are not very smart when they start.
            These networks must be trained, but not how a person would train a dog
            or teach a child. The network tries to do something and if it fails,
            that part of the network is no longer in the next generation. Just like
            a single person is called an individual, a single part of a network
            is called a node. After taking all of the better nodes, the network 
            is trained repeatedly until it is getting all of the answers correct. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The first type, NORB is completely trained within five generations of nodes.
            This has been researched thoroughly, but was recently used to help material scientists
            find better materials for locations with high temperatures. The error 
            rate is around 2.5% which is extraordinary compared to the amount of 
            data it is fed. Unlike humans, computers do not recognize features as 
            we do. For example, when a person sees a cat, this is evident because 
            it has features that place this into our brains. Computers do not work 
            this way, they require hundreds of thousands of  photos to recognize that 
            it is a cat. The easiest piece of evidence for this is writing on a tablet 
            and the words are being processed with a fair amount of accuracy. This is easy for 
            computers since it can recognize pixels, but if it is fed an image of handwriting, 
            nothing is recognized. Handwriting researchers have trained networks to recognize 
            handwriting from photos. Look at the sources page for more information on this.
