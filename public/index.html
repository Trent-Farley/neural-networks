      Introduction
    </h2>

    <p>
      Neural networks will be the future of every industry. The amount of 
      data for humans to process as the world advances is staggering, and 
      with the help of neural networks, the copious amounts of information
      can be processed easier. There are multiple types of networks that can 
      be made, with all of them being better at doing a task. From self-driving 
      cars to finding your friend's photo that they just posted, it is all
      using neural networks, or also known as machine learning.
