    <h3>
      Introduction
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Neural networks will be the future of every industry. The amount of 
      data for humans to process as the world advances is staggering, and 
      with the help of neural networks, the copious amounts of information
      can be processed easier. There are multiple types of networks that can 
      be made, with all of them being better at doing a task. From self-driving 
      cars to finding your friend's photo that they just posted, it is all
      using neural networks, or also known as machine learning.

    <h3>
      So what is a neural network?
    </h3>
    <p>
      To put it simply, neural network is a way of processing information to become 
      summarized into something that is understandable. A network is how a machine 
      learns, which is a combination of evolution and trial and error. To start one,
      the programmer creates a solution and if the smaller parts or "Nodes". To learn more 
      about the Implementation, check out the Implementation page.  Here is a 
      video from PBS that goes into more detail about an overview of a network:
