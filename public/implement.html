    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p>
      The amount of information on the implementation of machine networks is staggering.
      From material science to recognizing handwriting, the amount of increasing
      data that can be processed is staggering. To implement something as 
      researched as this, there has to be a bit of calculus and higher level
      math. Both of these areas (Material science and image recognition) are researched
      heavily and are linked under the sources page.

    <h3><b>How to implement a neural network</b></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create an end goal</li>
      <li>Initialize weight of node (starting point)</li>
      <li>Trim the failed nodes from the structure</li>
      <li>Repeat until goal is accomplished</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      As discussed by the theory of neural networks, the great thing 
      about computers is that they do not care how 
      many times a task needs to be repeated for it to finish. As 
      humans, we think of the repetitive chores as a burden and try 
      to avoid them. Computers, however, are very good at this and 
      can reiterate and complete a task in a mere instant. It is not 
      unheard of a neural network to hit 200 generations of nodes still
      working on a problem.
